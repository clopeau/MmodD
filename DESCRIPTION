Description: The MmodD project -Modular Modeling- contains tools for the study
and solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) in 2d and 3d. 
A set of command-line functions and a graphical user interface let you 
preprocess, solve, and postprocess generic PDEs for a broad range of
engineering and science applications.
