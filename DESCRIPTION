Description: The MmodD project -Modular Modeling- is a finite element toolbox for the study
 and solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) in 2d and 3d. A set of command-line
 functions and a graphical user interface let you preprocess, solve, and postprocess generic
 PDEs for a broad range of engineering and science applications.
